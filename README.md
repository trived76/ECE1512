# ECE1512 Digital Image Processing and its Application (in Machine Learning field)
This course is on Image Processing. This repository contains my work in this course. (Winter 2019)
Work to be added soon.

All the codes are written in Matlab. Three image enhancement techniques are applied:
(1) Log Transformation 
(2) Power-law transformation
(3) Histogram Equalisation

Log and Power-law transformations are point-wise image enhancement techniques, while Histogram equalisation is wholistic approach for image enhancement in spatial domain.
